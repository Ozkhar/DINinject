# DINinject
Dependency Injection is a pattern part of SOLID Best practices. This corresponds to decoupled components. With dependency injection, high level modules/classes, are not tight to low level ones. Rather an interface is used to inject to the constructor the specific functionality that is intended to happen. This project shows an implementation of dependency injection with the use of the popular Framework called Ninject which is a IOC Container. With the use of a IOC container, we can bind the different interfaces and methods that we are using to inject the desired functionality and ninject will create the required objects so the dependency injection can be performed easily.
